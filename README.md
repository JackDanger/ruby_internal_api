# Ruby internal_api

This is a gem for decomposing monolithic Rails apps. It allows you to specify an internal class or module that serves as the internal api for another class or module.

Example:

```ruby
# This is the api you present to other code within the monolith for
# managing payment transactions.
module PaymentApi
  def charge(amount_cents, options = {})
    # This is whatever bespoke, ugly code you've inherited in your existing app.
    record = PaymentRecord.create(amount_cents)
    issue = Payments::Issue.new(record).complete!
    log(issue)
  end
end

# The internal_api gem allows you to ensure that the above `PaymentApi`
# module is the only way anyone can call your code.
class PaymentRecord < ActiveRecord::Base
  internal_api PaymentApi
end

module Payments
  class Issue
    internal_api PaymentApi
  end
end


# So when someone adds a new dependency to your internal code they fail their unit tests:
module Onboarding
  def self.complete!(user)
    PaymentRecord.create(1_00, type: auth) 
    # other onboarding stuff
  end
end
Onboarding.complete(@user) #! Only `PaymentApi` methods can execute PaymentApi code.
```

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'internal_api'
```

## Performance

This API enforcement is purely dyamic - `internal_api` modified the runtime
execution of code and checks for correct access patterns. This has a nonzero
but completely negligible impact on performance and therefore can safely be run
in production.

If you come from a Java background you may be used to thinking of backtraces as
very expensive. In Ruby they're quite cheap - the backtrace is always available
in memory and accessing it only requires [turning](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/c3cf1ef9bbacac6ae5abc99046db173e258dc7ca/vm_backtrace.c#L549-L566) the C stack into (simple) Ruby
objects.

Constructing a single backtrace in running production code takes only a few microseconds on any
modern CPU:

    >> Benchmark.measure { 1_000_000.times { Kernel.caller_locations }}.real
    => 5.190758000011556
